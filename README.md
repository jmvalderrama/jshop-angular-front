# JShop Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3. This is an e-commerce example with sample products.

## Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Remember to run `npm install` before run development server for install all the dependencies and make sure you get the Angular CLI.

## Suggestions

If you use an Angular CLI version < 10, you can use `ng2-search-filter` package to filter products. HTML and module are in comments because Angular Ivy is not compatible with this package yet.
